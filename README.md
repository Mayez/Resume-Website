# Resume-Website
Instead of just handing in a resume and cover letter, I decided to combine the two mediums and create a product that is very appealing. Also, I decided to not use a drag and drop user interface such as Wix.com to create my website but, instead build one from scratch that can be just as good if not better. Also, it has allowed me to feed my passion for continously learning new kinds of technological related applications. In this project I learned to use HTML, CSS and to some degree JavaScript extensively. All in the name of learning. It is not completed yet but, it should be sometime soon.
